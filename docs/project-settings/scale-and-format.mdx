            **Change the scale of your project**

            1. Tap **Scale**
            2. Choose from 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:5

            **Change your content fit**

            - Fill - Your video will be scaled to fill the entire frame. If your video's aspect ratio is not the same as the frame, you'll notice that the video will be cropped.
            - Fit - Your video will be scaled to fit entirely within the frame. If your video's aspect ratio is not the same as the frame, you'll see black pillars on the sides.
            - Auto - Your video will fill the entire frame and we'll use AI to attempt to center the frame on the important content of the video.
