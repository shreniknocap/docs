Before you go, please [get in touch](/docs/support/support#send-us-a-message) to let us know if there is anything we could have done to improve your experience.

**Before deleting your account, please know that:**

- If you have an active subscription, please remember to cancel your subscription before deleting your account.
- Any projects you have exported will remain in your Photos app. However, your projects will be deleted and cannot be restored. Please export your projects before you delete your account.
- Currently, we are not able to restore your account. In other words, deleting your account is permanent.

**Once your account has been deleted**

It is not possible to recover your account. If you purchased a subscription via the App Store, your subscription is tied to your Apple ID, not your email address or phone number. So, you can simply create a new account with a new sign up method and tap "Restore Subscription" on the top right. Your subscription will be transferred to your new log in method.
