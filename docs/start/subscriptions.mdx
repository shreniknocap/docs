# Plans
When you purchase a subscription to Captions, you can purchase once and use your subscription on multiple devices. Subscriptions are only for a single user, but we are planning on launching a teams feature which will allow a single user to purchase and manage multiple teammates.

### Captions PRO

Captions PRO is available as a weekly, monthly, or yearly subscription and includes all features in the app. There are no limits to the number of projects you can export.

### Captions MAX
Captions MAX is available as a monthly or yearly subscription and includes everything in Captions PRO in addition to priority support.
<Note>
        We do not offer a free version of Captions.

# Pricing & Payment Methods

**Pricing will vary depending on:**

- The plan you choose: PRO or MAX
- The duration of your subscription: Weekly, monthly, or yearly
- How you pay: Stripe, App Store, or Play Store

### Stripe
To pay with credit card, debit card, or Cash app, please sign up or sign in at [desktop.captions.ai/subscription](https://desktop.captions.ai/subscription). If you require an invoice with a VAT number, you must purchase via Stripe. Note: We partner with Stripe to manage billing and subscriptions.

### App Store
As billing is managed via the App Store, the price of Captions PRO and Captions MAX will be converted to the currency supported by the App Store in your country or region.

If you dismiss this page and create a project, you'll see the page again upon exporting. If you sign up via the App Store, we do offer a one-time, 3 day trial.
